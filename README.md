### ThyreosAI ‚Äî Clinical Thyroid Risk Predictor

**ThyreosAI** is a machine learning‚Äìpowered clinical decision support tool that predicts thyroid conditions based on patient data.
Built for reliability and ease of integration in healthcare environments, it provides accurate risk classification to assist
clinicians and researchers.


### Research Foundation

This project implements diagnosis logic and selective feature techniques inspired by:

"Thyroid Disease Prediction Using Selective Features and Machine Learning Techniques"
[üìñ View Paper on PubMed Central](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9405591/)

We adopted the paper‚Äôs target class logic, addressed missing values, and refined diagnosis classification using structured domain rules for better clinical alignment.


### Features

- ‚úÖ Cleaned & preprocessed dataset from UCI ML Repository (via Kaggle)
- üß™ Trained multi-class classifier on selected clinical features
- ‚öôÔ∏è RESTful API using FastAPI for real-time predictions
- üîê Secure session-based access (ready for extension with auth)
- üìä Confidence scoring and interpretable output labels
- üñ•Ô∏è UI-friendly response structure for frontend integration



### Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python, FastAPI, Pydantic
- **ML**: scikit-learn, NumPy, pandas
- **Frontend**: Cursor (AI-generated UI)
- **Deployment**: Designed for Heroku, Vercel, or local use
- **Dataset**: UCI Thyroid Disease Dataset (Kaggle version)



### Prediction Classes

| Class ID | Label     | Meaning                            |
|----------|-----------|------------------------------------|
| 0        | Negative  | No thyroid disorder detected       |
| 1        | Hypo      | Hypothyroidism detected            |
| 2        | Hyper     | Hyperthyroidism detected           |
| 3        | Other     | Other thyroid-related abnormalities|
| 4        | Misc      | Miscellaneous/uncertain conditions |




### Example API Usage

**Endpoint:** `POST /predict/`  
**Payload:**

```json
{
  "age": 45,
  "sex": 1,
  "on_thyroxine": 1,
  "TSH": 2.4,
  "T3": 1.5,
  "TT4": 110.0,
  "T4U": 1.0,
  "FTI": 105.0,
  "referral_source": 2
}
````

**Response:**

```json
{
  "prediction": 1,
  "label": "hypo",
  "confidence": 0.92
}
```



### Dataset

This project uses a preprocessed version of the [Thyroid Disease Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/thyroid+disease) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset was cleaned (missing values removed), categorical features encoded, and diagnosis labels grouped into meaningful classes based on clinical literature.

# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/thyreos-ai
cd thyreos-ai

### About

ThyreosAI was developed as part of an academic‚Äìclinical initiative to explore how machine learning can support early thyroid risk prediction using publicly available health data. The tool is intended to assist clinicians in fast, explainable triaging of thyroid-related conditions while being accessible for researchers and data scientists.
